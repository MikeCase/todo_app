## Todo list app. Just the basics. 

### Currently

It shows an interface, and you can click the button to add an item to the tasklist. 

### Future

* Adding persistence. Probably sqlite DB to keep it self contained. 
* Clean up the interface
* Change task list to a task list of checkboxes, if checked complete. update DB to show completeness.

Using customTKinter for the UI. It's clean and modern looking I like it. Credit to the maker **update **
